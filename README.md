# Sync Token Names
 Simple Foundry VTT module to syncronize actor names with token names.

 # Usage
 Simple enable the module and it'll automatically syncronize the token name everytime you change an actor's name.
 If you want to disable the sync, just disable the module.
 Duplicate your actors and rename them. No more tokens with generic names!
